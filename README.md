# Flight Predictions

I was given this exercise by a company. They wanted me to 'just analyze the data and come up with some predictions, if possible, but not spend 
more than 2-3 hours on this exercise'

As such, the repository contains SSIS ETL code, sql scripts to analyze data, some rudimentary prediction code for flight delays using 
Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees.

For analysis, I also quickly drew some bar charts, et al.
